# DL-Final-Project
This is a multi-class text classification problem where email is assigned to one of 3 categories. 
The classifier makes the assumption that each new complaint is assigned to one and only one category. 
Text features needed to be represented numerically and in this project I compare between TF-IDF and Word Embeddings.
