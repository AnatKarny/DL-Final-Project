# DL-Final-Project
Emails template classifier. Assign email to one of 3 categories. 
The classifier makes the assumption that each new complaint is assigned to one and only one category. 
This is multi-class text classification problem. Text features needed to be represented numerically.
In this project I compare between TF-IDF and Word Embeddings.
